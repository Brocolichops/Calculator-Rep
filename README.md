This is one of my first front-end based website projects. It's a fairly generic calculator that is very intuitive to use. However for those of you unable to comprehend the complex intricacies of my calculator, here's a brief rundown:

  1. Upon opening the website you'll be met with a rather aesthetically pleasing machine.
  2. In order to perform an operation just click on the numbers/type them from your keyboard.
  3. Click on the operator you'd like to implement
  4. Enter the second number.
  5. Click on the little '=' button on the bottom right/press 'Enter' and VOILA.

This is my first ever recorded project however prior to me starting this project, I have been learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript for good couple of months. Enjoy!
