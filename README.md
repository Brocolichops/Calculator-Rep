This is one of my first front-end based website projects. It's a fairly generic calculator that is very intuitive to use. However for those of you unable to comprehend the complex intricacies of my calculator, here's a brief rundown:

TO RUN THE WEBPAGE:   
  1. Download the ZIP file.
  2. Extract the file in a single directory.
  3. Right-click on the HTML file.
  4. Navigate to the 'open with' option and choose a browser of your liking (preferably Google Chrome).

USING THE CALCULATOR:  

  1. Upon opening the website you'll be met with a rather aesthetically pleasing machine.
  2. In order to perform an operation just click on the numbers/type them from your keyboard.
  3. Click on the operator you'd like to use.
  4. Enter the second number.
  5. Click on the little '=' button on the bottom right/press 'Enter' and VOILA.

This is a visualization of the webapp dev. Makes it easier for me to understand the logic behind my code and acts as a pseudo-pseudocode.
